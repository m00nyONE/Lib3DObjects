# Lib3DObjects OSI Compatibility Layer
- This here is only a compatibility layer to enable older addons using OSI as a dependency to work with Lib3DObjects.
- Do NOT use this layer in new addons! Instead, directly depend on Lib3DObjects and use its API.
- The compatibility layer tries to emulate OSI's behavior as closely as possible, but there might be differences and missing features. If you find any, let me know!
- This part of the Library will likely release as a separate addon in the future to allow other addons depending on it. 

### Credits:
- ALL icons in the icons/ folder are from OdySupportIcons and are NOT created by me!
- ALL function names and structures are taken from OSI and are NOT created by me! - I only created wrappers around them and a central ObjectClass to emulate OSI's behavior.
